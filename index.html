            <h2>Not Your Model Minority</h2>
            <p>Let’s talk about this past week and the hate crimes perpetrated
            against Asian Americans the last few days in Oakland
            Let’s talk about this past year and our past period in American history
            This neglected narrative
            This invisible experience
            
            While the country does its annual round of capitalizing
            off of Lunar New Year this weekend, I think about the Asian Americans who will spend
            what is supposed to be one of the most festive and important holidays in their culture
            cowering instead of celebrating
            Let me tell you about the attacks that have been happening
            because you won’t find them headlining on national news
            A conversation that is long overdue
            
            An 84 year old Thai man was attacked in bright daylight and died from his injuries
            Vicha Ratanapakdee
            Say his name
            and pronounce all. of. it.
            
            Numerous robberies and assaults in Oakland’s Chinatown
            A 91 year old man was pushed down
            It was like watching my own grandfather get slammed into the pavement
            Look up the video on your own if you want to see it
            but I refuse to circulate Trauma Porn – my trauma, your porn
            Non-POC: You cannot fathom how personally traumatizing it is to watch these videos
            
            Faces slashed, grandmothers set on fire
            The sheer volume of violence is staggering
            I’m having a hard time grappling with this inhumanity against our elderly
            Our elders
            Who are revered and respected in our culture in a way unlike the culture of this country
            Who rose from the ruins of a broken nation seeking solace
            Searching for a better life in the Land of Opportunity that only knew them by the word
            Foreigner
            
            In the wake of these assaults there is one word that comes to mind
            A word that has been grinded and conditioned into the Asian American experience:
            Invisible
            Anti-Asian sentiment since the beginning of this pandemic
            Targeted hate crimes have surged by almost two thousand percent
            
            Where are you, CNN?
            Where are you, my fellow activists and leaders of social justice?
            Deafening silence from the news media and our so-called allies
            Feigned outrage only when it’s trendy
            I am traumatized by your apathy
            
            You cannot be anti-racist without acknowledging the Asian American experience.
            
            Enough with the narrative of the Model Minority
            What is the Model Minority Myth?
            I guess I’ll save you the self-education
            And tell you about a nation that only respects you when
            you keep your head down and talk nice
            Get good grades and that’s the price
            of being tolerated in White America
            But despite staying out of trouble and being quiet
            equality never comes with being compliant
            
            Because you see,
            the Model Minority Myth was weaponized
            by our government back during the Civil Rights movement
            to say that there is a “correct” way to be a minority
            The audacity of White Supremacy
            To give us a pat on the head for being silent
            To take a diverse race of people and reduce them to a monolith
            The audacity of White Supremacy
            To use us as their tools to undermine the Black fight for civil rights
            To pit minority groups against each other and further the divide
            
            A nation built on the backs of
            Black people and immigrants
            Born with this burden that we were doomed to carry
            as soon as our lungs drew in the first breath
            The breath that got heavier and heavier with each year of life
            A life of N*****, Ch*nk, Oriental, “blacks” as a noun with a lower-case B,
            Dred Scott, Korematsu, Plessy
            Yellow Peril, Chinese Excluded, For Colored Only
            A life of imperialism and colonization and cultural appropriation
            A life of “I think you may have confused me with the other [insert indistinguishable face of color] in this room” and
            “I’ve never dated a [insert fetishizable object of color] person before” and
            “But what’s your real name” and
            “Can I touch your braids” and
            “Your English is good” and
            “You don’t sound Black” and
            “Your lunch smells funny” and
            “Go back to your country”
            
            No amount of the Model Minority Myth embedded in deep interracial conflict
            will change the fact that we have always been seen and treated as secondary citizens
            If citizens at all
            
            From a young age I didn’t know how to take up space
            It’s having to laugh off microaggressions because
            we are made to feel that the racism against us isn’t real – is miniscule, is just a joke
            Gaslit over and over
            We are told to embrace our “good stereotypes”
            I mean what exactly is our plight when
            we’re all just so good at math
            Right?
            But this Myth invalidates the reality of the Asian American experience
            Our internalized racism, our intergenerational traumas
            Our women the subject of hyper-sexualization
            Our men the epitome of emasculation
            It paints us as submissive and void of personality
            Strips us of our individuality
            It erases the millions of low income Asian Americans that exist in poverty
            It ignores the historic underfunding of Chinatowns as people huddle
            around what little reminders they have of their homeland
            It silences our struggles and shoves them to the sidelines
            This repulsive notion of white proximity
            
            I’m tired of being told that we are not Oppressed Enough.
            Enough.
            
            We are not your model minority.
            
            I’ve said this a hundred times and I’ll say it again:
            The burden should not fall on people of color to be educators
            I’m going to be honest and I hope you will be modest enough to listen
            Because writing this piece was so exhausting
            So emotionally draining
            I wanted to swallow my words, swallow my pain
            To shut off my brain and just mourn in bed
            I wished I was privileged enough to write about Snow Day instead
            But instead I opened a Google Doc and my curtains and my wounds
            
            This toxic rhetoric of
            “Your oppression isn’t as bad as mine” and
            “Now is not the time”
            Sorry but
            I didn’t know that racism had a sign-up sheet
            A hate crime against one community is a hate crime against all of our communities
            We all suffer under the puppetting hand of this systemic oppression
            The problem is not us and each other and this underlying tension
            The problem is White Supremacy so pay attention
            
            If your anti-racism isn’t intersectional, are you really anti-racist?
            Don’t ask us to shrink our space when we have already gone
            our whole lives feeling small
            I promise that there is enough space to go around this arena of
            Oppression Olympics that was designed to be the modern day Hunger Games
            Designed to point fingers and call names but we are all pawns of the same system
            So shouldn’t we be asking instead: who designed it?
            And how do we get out?
            Unity is not possible with White Supremacy
            But unity against it is necessary to defeat it
            The only way out is together
            Diversify your narratives so we can do and be better
            So that we can uplift all of our communities and stand in solidarity
            This struggle for safety
            This struggle for scraps
            of space at each other’s expense
            
            But now that I’m here, let me make this clear:
            Asian Americans cannot find safety in the same institutions
            that terrorize Black Americans
            Although we are wounded, the police must still be defunded
            Increased policing is not the answer
            Black Lives Matter
            So we must make good on our promise from last summer
            To use our privilege and protect the Black community
            So instead of calling for increased policing that will harm Black bodies
            Let’s get to the root and provide adequate services and resources
            for all of our communities
            Let’s rid this false notion that there is mutual exclusivity in this fight for equality
            The solution lies in addressing this violence that is rooted in White Supremacy
            A violence that is not the violence that we see but the violence that is
            Unemployment, Homelessness, Wealth Hoarding, Redlining, and Poverty
            
            So let’s turn this mentality into a new story
            One where Asian Americans can take up space unapologetically
            and speak their truths and shed their invisibility
            One where our white and POC allies support us openly
            by condemning anti-Asian violence in their own communities
            I challenge you to check your own biases
            and follow through on your commitment to diversity
            See us, show up for us, and take on responsibility
            Hold accountability
            
            Marginalized freedoms have always been and will always be intertwined
            My pain is your pain is our collective pain
            It is our collective grief and our collective loss
            And so your fight is my fight and my fight
            Should be yours, too</p>
