            <h1>Not Your Model Minority</h1>
            <p>Let’s talk about this past week and the hate crimes perpetrated</p>
            <p>against Asian Americans the last few days in Oakland</p>
            <p>Let’s talk about this past year and our past period in American history</p>
            <p>This neglected narrative</p>
            <p>This invisible experience</p>
            <br>
            <p>While the country does its annual round of capitalizing</p>
            <p>off of Lunar New Year this weekend, I think about the Asian Americans who will spend</p>
            <p>what is supposed to be one of the most festive and important holidays in their culture</p>
            <p>cowering instead of celebrating</p>
            <p>Let me tell you about the attacks that have been happening</p>
            <p>because you won’t find them headlining on national news</p>
            <p>A conversation that is long overdue</p>
            <br>
            <p>An 84 year old Thai man was attacked in bright daylight and died from his injuries</p>
            <p>Vicha Ratanapakdee</p>
            <p>Say his name</p>
            <p>and pronounce all. of. it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Numerous robberies and assaults in Oakland’s Chinatown</p>
            <p>A 91 year old man was pushed down</p>
            <p>It was like watching my own grandfather get slammed into the pavement</p>
            <p>Look up the video on your own if you want to see it</p>
            <p>but I refuse to circulate Trauma Porn – my trauma, your porn</p>
            <p>Non-POC: You cannot fathom how personally traumatizing it is to watch these videos</p>
            <br>
            <p>Faces slashed, grandmothers set on fire</p>
            <p>The sheer volume of violence is staggering</p>
            <p>I’m having a hard time grappling with this inhumanity against our elderly</p>
            <p>Our elders</p>
            <p>Who are revered and respected in our culture in a way unlike the culture of this country</p>
            <p>Who rose from the ruins of a broken nation seeking solace</p>
            <p>Searching for a better life in the Land of Opportunity that only knew them by the word</p>
            <p>Foreigner</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the wake of these assaults there is one word that comes to mind</p>
            <p>A word that has been grinded and conditioned into the Asian American experience:</p>
            <p>Invisible</p>
            <p>Anti-Asian sentiment since the beginning of this pandemic</p>
            <p>Targeted hate crimes have surged by almost two thousand percent</p>
            <br>
            <p>Where are you, CNN?</p>
            <p>Where are you, my fellow activists and leaders of social justice?</p>
            <p>Deafening silence from the news media and our so-called allies</p>
            <p>Feigned outrage only when it’s trendy</p>
            <p>I am traumatized by your apathy</p>
            <br>
            <p>You cannot be anti-racist without acknowledging the Asian American experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Enough with the narrative of the Model Minority</p>
            <p>What is the Model Minority Myth?</p>
            <p>I guess I’ll save you the self-education</p>
            <p>And tell you about a nation that only respects you when</p>
            <p>you keep your head down and talk nice</p>
            <p>>Get good grades and that’s the price</p>
            <p>of being tolerated in White America</p>
            <p>But despite staying out of trouble and being quiet</p>
            <p>equality never comes with being compliant</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because you see,</p>
            <p>the Model Minority Myth was weaponized</p>
            <p>by our government back during the Civil Rights movement</p>
            <p>to say that there is a “correct” way to be a minority</p>
            <p>The audacity of White Supremacy</p>
            <p>To give us a pat on the head for being silent</p>
            <p>To take a diverse race of people and reduce them to a monolith</p>
            <p>The audacity of White Supremacy</p>
            <p>To use us as their tools to undermine the Black fight for civil rights</p>
            <p>To pit minority groups against each other and further the divide</p>
            <br>
            <p>A nation built on the backs of</p>
            <p>Black people and immigrants</p>
            <p>Born with this burden that we were doomed to carry</p>
            <p>as soon as our lungs drew in the first breath</p>
            <p>The breath that got heavier and heavier with each year of life</p>
            <p>A life of N*****, Ch*nk, Oriental, “blacks” as a noun with a lower-case B,</p>
            <p>Dred Scott, Korematsu, Plessy</p>
            <p>Yellow Peril, Chinese Excluded, For Colored Only</p>
            <p>A life of imperialism and colonization and cultural appropriation</p>
            <p>A life of “I think you may have confused me with the other [insert indistinguishable face
            <p>of color] in this</p> room” and</p>
            <p>“I’ve never dated a [insert fetishizable object of color] person before” and</p>
            <p>“But what’s your real name” and</p>
            <p>“Can I touch your braids” and</p>
            <p>“Your English is good” and</p>
            <p>“You don’t sound Black” and</p>
            <p>“Your lunch smells funny” and</p>
            <p>“Go back to your country”</p>
            <br>
            <p>No amount of the Model Minority Myth embedded in deep interracial conflict</p>
            <p>will change the fact that we have always been seen and treated as secondary citizens</p>
            <p>If citizens at all</p>
            <br>
            <p>From a young age I didn’t know how to take up space</p>
            <p>It’s having to laugh off microaggressions because</p>
            <p>we are made to feel that the racism against us isn’t real – is miniscule, is just a joke</p>
            <p>Gaslit over and over</p>
            <p>We are told to embrace our “good stereotypes”</p>
            <p>I mean what exactly is our plight when</p>
            <p>we’re all just so good at math</p>
            <p>Right?</p>
            <p>But this Myth invalidates the reality of the Asian American experience</p>
            <p>Our internalized racism, our intergenerational traumas</p>
            <p>Our women the subject of hyper-sexualization</p>
            <p>Our men the epitome of emasculation</p>
            <p>It paints us as submissive and void of personality</p>
            <p>Strips us of our individuality</p>
            <p>It erases the millions of low income Asian Americans that exist in poverty</p>
            <p>It ignores the historic underfunding of Chinatowns as people huddle</p>
            <p>around what little reminders they have of their homeland</p>
            <p>It silences our struggles and shoves them to the sidelines</p>
            <p>This repulsive notion of white proximity</p>
            <br>
            <p>I’m tired of being told that we are not Oppressed Enough.</p>
            <p>Enough.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We are not your model minority.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I’ve said this a hundred times and I’ll say it again:</p>
            <p>The burden should not fall on people of color to be educators</p>
            <p>I’m going to be honest and I hope you will be modest enough to listen</p>
            <p>Because writing this piece was so exhausting</p>
            <p>So emotionally draining</p>
            <p>I wanted to swallow my words, swallow my pain</p>
            <p>To shut off my brain and just mourn in bed</p>
            <p>I wished I was privileged enough to write about Snow Day instead</p>
            <p>But instead I opened a Google Doc and my curtains and my wounds</p>
            <br>
            <p>This toxic rhetoric of</p>
            <p>“Your oppression isn’t as bad as mine” and</p>
            <p>“Now is not the time”</p>
            <p>Sorry but</p>
            <p>I didn’t know that racism had a sign-up sheet</p>
            <p>A hate crime against one community is a hate crime against all of our communities</p>
            <p>We all suffer under the puppetting hand of this systemic oppression</p>
            <p>The problem is not us and each other and this underlying tension</p>
            <p>The problem is White Supremacy so pay attention</p>
            <br>
            <p>If your anti-racism isn’t intersectional, are you really anti-racist?</p>
            <p>Don’t ask us to shrink our space when we have already gone</p>
            <p>our whole lives feeling small</p>
            <p>I promise that there is enough space to go around this arena of</p>
            <p>Oppression Olympics that was designed to be the modern day Hunger Games</p>
            <p>Designed to point fingers and call names but we are all pawns of the same system</p>
            <p>So shouldn’t we be asking instead: who designed it?</p>
            <p>And how do we get out?</p>
            <p>Unity is not possible with White Supremacy</p>
            <p>But unity against it is necessary to defeat it</p>
            <p>The only way out is together</p>
            <p>Diversify your narratives so we can do and be better</p>
            <p>So that we can uplift all of our communities and stand in solidarity</p>
            <p>This struggle for safety</p>
            <p>This struggle for scraps</p>
            <p>of space at each other’s expense</p>
            <br>
            <p>But now that I’m here, let me make this clear:</p>
            <p>Asian Americans cannot find safety in the same institutions</p>
            <p>that terrorize Black Americans</p>
            <p>Although we are wounded, the police must still be defunded</p>
            <p>Increased policing is not the answer</p>
            <p>Black Lives Matter</p>
            <p>So we must make good on our promise from last summer</p>
            <p>To use our privilege and protect the Black community</p>
            <p>So instead of calling for increased policing that will harm Black bodies</p>
            <p>Let’s get to the root and provide adequate services and resources</p>
            <p>for all of our communities</p>
            <p>Let’s rid this false notion that there is mutual exclusivity in this fight for equality</p>
            <p>The solution lies in addressing this violence that is rooted in White Supremacy</p>
            <p>A violence that is not the violence that we see but the violence that is</p>
            <p>Unemployment, Homelessness, Wealth Hoarding, Redlining, and Poverty</p>
            <br>
            <p>So let’s turn this mentality into a new story</p>
            <p>One where Asian Americans can take up space unapologetically</p>
            <p>and speak their truths and shed their invisibility</p>
            <p>One where our white and POC allies support us openly</p>
            <p>by condemning anti-Asian violence in their own communities</p>
            <p>I challenge you to check your own biases</p>
            <p>and follow through on your commitment to diversity</p>
            <p>See us, show up for us, and take on responsibility</p>
            <p>Hold accountability</p>
            <br>
            <p>Marginalized freedoms have always been and will always be intertwined</p>
            <p>My pain is your pain is our collective pain</p>
            <p>It is our collective grief and our collective loss</p>
            <p>And so your fight is my fight and my fight</p>
            <p>Should be yours, too</p>
            <br>
